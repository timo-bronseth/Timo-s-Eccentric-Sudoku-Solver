# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The goal I had in mind for this code was to minimise the need for brute force search.
# For that, I use two main algorithms:
#    1) "possibility_eliminator()" for solving almost all determinate puzzles quickly,
#    2) and brute search for indeterminate puzzles.
#
# I made this while learning Python from scratch, which should be evident from my utterly
# abhorrent code. I haven't had time to tidy it up yet, and due to Yule vacation
# approaching, I didn't have time to code the last bits proper either. But it works!
